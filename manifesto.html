        <h2><img src="svg/icons/puzzle.svg" class="framework-icon rotate-n10" alt=""> 1. One person is enough.</h2>
        <p>
          The name "Dimwit" comes from the knuckleheadedness of believing one person can be an entire software lab. But here's the thing: <strong>I can</strong>. No consensus-building. No meetings about meetings. Just me solving problems I actually have.
        </p>

      <article class="manifesto-point">
        <h2>2. Be your own first user. <img src="svg/icons/user.svg" class="framework-icon rotate-5" alt=""></h2>
        <p>
          Every project here starts from a personal itch. If I don't use it, I don't build it.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="manifesto-point">
        <h2><img src="svg/icons/scissors.svg" class="framework-icon rotate-n12" alt=""> 3. Minimal, not lazy.</h2>
        <p>
          There's a difference between "I didn't add features" and "I carefully chose not to." My projects are opinionated. They do less, but what they do, they do well. Every feature either serves the core purpose or gets cut.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="manifesto-point">
        <h2>4. Your data stays yours. <img src="svg/icons/shield.svg" class="framework-icon rotate-8" alt=""></h2>
        <p>
          I don't spy on you. If something needs to collect data (syncing, payments), you'll know exactly what, why, and where it goes. Plain English, no lawyer-speak. And if something can work without collecting anything? It won't collect anything.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="manifesto-point">
        <h2><img src="svg/icons/heart.svg" class="framework-icon rotate-n8" alt=""> 5. Vibes matter.</h2>
        <p>
          Software should feel good to use. Not just functional but pleasant. Clean APIs. Sensible defaults. Documentation that makes sense. Thoughtful font choices. Harmony in colour. That slight satisfaction when something just works is the key.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="manifesto-point">
        <h2>6. Craft over metrics. <img src="svg/icons/trophy.svg" class="framework-icon rotate-12" alt=""></h2>
        <p>
          Engagement isn't my goal. Retention isn't my goal. Making something good is. I care more about the relationship between a tool and its user than growth charts. Some things are worth building even if only twelve people use them.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="manifesto-point">
        <h2>7. Transparency in all things. <img src="svg/icons/globe.svg" class="framework-icon rotate-10" alt=""></h2>
        <p>
          Some projects are open source because sharing makes them better. Some are closed because sustainability requires it. Neither is inherently virtuous. I just want to build things that can survive and keep helping people.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="manifesto-point">
        <h2>8. Small is sustainable. <img src="svg/icons/coffee.svg" class="framework-icon rotate-n5" alt=""></h2>
        <p>
          I won't "scale." I don't need investors or a team or an office. Just me, working on things I care about, at a pace that doesn't burn me out. This isn't a stepping stone to something bigger. This is the destination.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="manifesto-point">
        <h2><img src="svg/icons/rocket.svg" class="framework-icon rotate-n20" alt=""> 9. The world has enough apps.</h2>
        <p>
          Every project here either solves something genuinely lacking or reimagines something that's become bloated. If a good solution already exists, I'm not going to compete just to compete.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="manifesto-point">
        <h2><img src="svg/icons/star.svg" class="framework-icon rotate-n15" alt=""> 10. Have fun with it.</h2>
        <p>
          Life's too short for boring software. I name things dramatically. I add whimsy. I insert easter eggs <img src="svg/icons/egg.svg" class="framework-icon rotate-10" alt="">. If I'm not enjoying the process, what's even the point?
